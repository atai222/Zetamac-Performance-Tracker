## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store

*(coming soon)*


### From Source (Development)
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zetamac-tracker.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Extension
├── Content Script (content.js)
│   ├── Monitors game state
│   ├── Validates default settings
│   ├── Tracks problem timing
│   └── Saves to Chrome Storage
│
└── Popup Interface (popup.js + popup.html)
    ├── Retrieves stored data
    ├── Calculates statistics
    ├── Generates visualizations
    └── Manages achievements
```

### Key Technologies
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Zero dependencies for optimal performance
- **Chrome Storage API** - Persistent local data storage
- **MutationObserver API** - Real-time DOM monitoring
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** - Responsive layouts
- **Local-First Design** - All data stays in your browser

### Performance Optimizations
- Sub-5ms problem detection latency
- Efficient batch storage updates
- Debounced calculations
- Lightweight DOM operations


## Project Structure

```
zetamac-tracker/
├── manifest.json           # Extension configuration
├── popup.html             # Statistics interface
├── scripts/
│   ├── popup.js          # Statistics calculations & UI
│   └── content.js        # Game monitoring script
└── icons/

```

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: Content script identifies when you're playing in default mode
2. **Monitoring**: Tracks each problem and solving time using MutationObserver
3. **Storage**: Saves results to Chrome's local storage
4. **Analysis**: Popup script processes data to generate insights
5. **Visualization**: Displays statistics through charts and grids
